# Social Media Capture Workflow

Capture and analyze social media profiles, storing intelligence to knowledge graph.

## Trigger Phrases
- "capture social profile"
- "social media intel"
- "profile analysis"
- "social media OSINT"
- "analyze social account"

## Input
- `target`: Username, handle (@user), or profile URL

---

## REQUIRED: Agent Delegation

**This workflow MUST be executed by a specialized OSINT agent via the Task tool.**

### Step 1: Generate Agent Prompt
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Agents/Tools/AgentFactory.ts \
  --traits "intelligence,meticulous,thorough" \
  --task "Capture and analyze social media profile '{target}' including profile data, engagement metrics, and content analysis" \
  --output json
```

### Step 2: Spawn Subagent (MANDATORY)

**IMMEDIATELY after getting the AgentFactory output, use the Task tool:**

```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "OSINT social capture for {target}"
  prompt: |
    [Paste the "prompt" field from AgentFactory JSON]

    ## Workflow Instructions
    [Include the Process steps below]

    ## Voice Output Required
    Include 🗣️ Collector: or 🗣️ Analyst: lines at start, key findings, and completion.
```

**Agent Traits:**
- `intelligence` - OSINT expertise and tradecraft
- `meticulous` - Detailed profile data extraction
- `thorough` - Complete content capture

⚠️ **FORBIDDEN: Executing this workflow directly without the Task tool spawn.**
⚠️ **WHY: Voice system requires SubagentStop hook, which only fires for Task subagents.**

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Platform
```
Parse input to determine:
- Platform (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Username/handle
- Profile URL format
```

### Step 2: Profile Data Collection

**Basic Profile Info:**
- Display name
- Username/handle
- Bio/description
- Profile picture
- Banner/header image
- Location (if provided)
- Website links
- Account creation date (if visible)
- Verification status

**Engagement Metrics:**
- Followers count
- Following count
- Post/tweet count
- Engagement rate (if calculable)

**Content Analysis:**
- Recent posts (last 20-50)
- Posting frequency
- Common topics/hashtags
- Mentioned accounts
- Media types used

### Step 3: Network Analysis
```
Map connections:
- Frequently mentioned accounts
- Reply patterns
- Retweet/share sources
- Tagged accounts in media
```

### Step 4: Temporal Analysis
```
Activity patterns:
- Most active times (hour of day)
- Most active days

```

### Step 5: Geolocation Indicators
```
Location clues:
- Stated location
- Geotagged posts
- Location mentions in content
- Time zone indicators from posting times
```

### Step: Output for Memory Capture

Format output with proper metadata so memory hooks can capture it automatically. Include frontmatter: the capture:

```
Store the following as structured episodes:

1. Social Account:
   - Name: "Social: {platform}/{handle}"
   - Data: Display name, bio, location, website, joined date, verified status
   - Group: "osint-social"

2. Engagement Metrics:
   - Name: "Metrics: {platform}/{handle}"
   - Data: Followers, following, post count, engagement rate
   - Temporal metadata for tracking changes

3. Network Connections:
   - Name: "Network: {handle}"
   - Data: Frequently mentioned accounts, top interactions, common hashtags
   - Relationships: mentions, interacts_with, follows

4. Activity Pattern:
   - Name: "Activity: {handle}"
   - Data: Most active times, peak days, posting frequency, last active
   - Inferred time zone
