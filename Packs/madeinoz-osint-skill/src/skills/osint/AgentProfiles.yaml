#
# 1. Using named profile:
#    "Spawn The Collector to enumerate all accounts for username 'target'"
#    -> Uses: research + meticulous + systematic + thorough
#
# 2. Using workflow mapping:
#    When running RiskAssessment.md, automatically spawn "The Auditor"
#
# 3. Parallel investigation:
#    "Run comprehensive person investigation on target"
#    -> Spawns: collector, linker, analyst in parallel
#
# 4. Direct trait composition via AgentFactory:
