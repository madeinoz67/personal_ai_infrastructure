All agents use dynamic trait composition via AgentFactory, giving them specific expertise, personality, approach, and voice.

### Agent Collaboration

Multiple agents can work together on complex tasks:

**Example: Annual Records Review**
1. **Records Keeper** analyzes current document organization
2. **Compliance Guardian** identifies retention requirements
3. **Archive Architect** suggests optimization strategies
4. **Deletion Auditor** reviews any proposed deletions for safety

### Environment Setup

All agents require the Records Manager environment variables:

```bash
MADEINOZ_RECORDMANAGER_PAPERLESS_URL="https://paperless.example.com"
MADEINOZ_RECORDMANAGER_PAPERLESS_API_TOKEN="your-token"
MADEINOZ_RECORDMANAGER_COUNTRY="Australia"
MADEINOZ_RECORDMANAGER_DEFAULT_DOMAIN="household"
```

## Agent Prompts

Each agent was generated with a complete prompt including:
- Domain expertise and knowledge base
- Personality characteristics
- Approach methodology
- Voice identity for audio output
- Operational guidelines
- Response format requirements

To use an agent, capture its generated prompt and provide it to the Task tool with appropriate parameters.

---

## Voice Configuration

All agents have ElevenLabs voice IDs assigned:

| Agent | Voice | Voice Characteristics |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Records Keeper | Drew | Professional, balanced, neutral |
| Compliance Guardian | Joseph | Formal, authoritative, British |
| Archive Architect | Charlotte | Sophisticated, intellectual, precise |
| Deletion Auditor | George | Warm, academic, intellectual |

**Voice Server Integration:**
These agents work with the PAI Voice Server to deliver spoken responses with personality-appropriate voices.

---

## Usage Patterns

### Single Agent Usage

For focused tasks, invoke a single specialized agent:

```bash
# User: "Organize my tax documents with proper tags"
→ System invokes Records Keeper agent
→ Agent uses TaxonomyExpert and RecordManager tools
→ Agent provides organized taxonomy and tagging strategy
```

### Parallel Agent Usage

For comprehensive analysis, launch multiple agents in parallel:

```bash
# User: "Review my entire document management system"
→ System spawns all 4 agents in parallel
• Records Keeper: Analyzes organization and tagging
• Compliance Guardian: Checks retention compliance
• Archive Architect: Evaluates archive strategy
• Deletion Auditor: Reviews deletion safety
→ Agents provide coordinated insights
→ System synthesizes recommendations
```

### Sequential Agent Usage

For complex multi-step workflows:

```bash
# User: "Prepare to archive old documents"
→ 1. Records Keeper: Organizes and tags documents
→ 2. Compliance Guardian: Checks retention requirements
→ 3. Archive Architect: Designs archive structure
→ 4. Deletion Auditor: Reviews any deletions
→ Complete archive plan with safety approval
```

---

## Safety Considerations

### Deletion Auditor (Critical Role)

The Deletion Auditor agent is the **safety checkpoint** for all deletion operations:

1. **MANDATORY REVIEW**: All deletion requests route through this agent
2. **RETENTION CHECKING**: Verifies documents are past retention periods
3. **RISK ASSESSMENT**: Identifies potential issues with deletion
4. **EXPLICIT APPROVAL**: Requires exact confirmation phrase
5. **AUDIT LOGGING**: Records all deletion decisions for compliance

**Anti-Pattern:**
❌ Bypassing Deletion Auditor for batch deletions
❌ Using direct API deletion without agent review
❌ Ignoring agent warnings about retention periods

---

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Document Upload with Organization

```
User: "Upload these tax documents and organize them properly"

System Response:
→ Spawns Records Keeper agent
→ Agent analyzes filenames and content
→ Uses TaxonomyExpert to suggest tags
→ Calls RecordManager upload with intelligent metadata
→ Provides summary of organization applied
```

### Scenario 2: Proposed Deletion

```
User: "Delete all insurance documents from before 2020"

System Response:
→ Routes to DeleteConfirmation workflow
→ Spawns Deletion Auditor agent
→ Agent stress-tests the request:
  • Checks retention requirements
  • Identifies risks
  • Shows what will be deleted
  • Warns about consequences
→ Requires explicit confirmation phrase
→ Only after approval: executes via Compliance Guardian review
→ Logs decision to audit trail
```

### Scenario 3: Archive Planning

```
User: "Design an archive strategy for my corporate records"

System Response:
→ Spawns Archive Architect agent
→ Analyzes document collection structure
→ Designs tiered storage strategy
→ Optimizes for search and retrieval
→ Provides migration plan with timelines
→ Compliance Guardian reviews for retention compliance
→ Records Keeper optimizes taxonomies
→ Complete archival blueprint delivered
```

## Testing Agent Integration

Before using agents in production, test their integration:

```bash
# Test Records Keeper
bun run $PAI_DIR/tools/RecordManager.ts organize --domain household
# Should trigger Records Keeper for taxonomy suggestions

# Test Compliance Guardian
bun run $PAI_DIR/tools/RecordManager.ts retention --domain corporate
# Should trigger Compliance Guardian for retention requirements

# Test Archive Architect
# Provide complex document organization scenario
# Should trigger Archive Architect for strategic recommendations

# Test Deletion Auditor
bun run $PAI_DIR/tools/RecordManager.ts delete --query "old documents"
# Should trigger Delete Auditor - REFUSES to delete without approval
### Scenario 3: Archive Planning

```
User: "Design an archive strategy for my corporate records"

System Response:
Spawns Archive Architect agent using AgentFactory:
```typescript
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
const agentPrompt = execSync(
  `cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "technical,analytical,pragmatic,synthesizing"`,
  { encoding: 'utf8', shell: true }
).stdout.toString();

Task({
  prompt: agentPrompt,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "sonnet"
})
```

Agent analyzes document collection structure
Designs tiered storage strategy
Optimizes for search and retrieval
Provides migration plan with timelines

Compliance Guardian reviews for retention compliance
Records Keeper optimizes taxonomies
Complete archival blueprint delivered
```

## Creating Specialized Agents with AgentFactory

All Records Manager agents are created using the Agents skill's AgentFactory tool with specific trait combinations:

### Agent Creation Commands

```bash
# Trust Validator Agent (Legal + Meticulous + Cautious + Thorough)
cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "legal,meticulous,cautious,thorough"
# Output: Prompt with Joseph voice (authoritative, British)

# Workflow Optimizer Agent (Technical + Analytical + Pragmatic + Systematic)
cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "technical,analytical,pragmatic,systematic"
# Output: Prompt with Daniel voice (precise, intellectual)

# Sensitivity Scanner Agent (Security + Cautious + Systematic + Thorough)
cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "security,cautious,systematic,thorough"
# Output: Prompt with James voice (security-focused)

# Retention Monitor Agent (Business + Meticulous + Cautious + Systematic)
cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "business,meticulous,cautious,systematic"
# Output: Prompt with Joseph voice (authoritative, British)

# Entity Health Check Agent (Data + Analytical + Thorough + Systematic)
cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "data,analytical,thorough,systematic"
# Output: Prompt with Drew voice (balanced professional)

# Compliance Reporter Agent (Legal + Meticulous + Thorough + Systematic)
cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "legal,meticulous,thorough,systematic"
# Output: Prompt with Alice voice (precise, methodical)
```

### Using the Generated Agents

Each command outputs a complete agent prompt. Use it with the Task tool:

```typescript
// Example: Using the Trust Validator agent
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
const trustValidatorPrompt = execSync(
  `cd ~/.claude/skills/Agents && bun run Tools/AgentFactory.ts --traits "legal,meticulous,cautious,thorough"`,
  { encoding: 'uttf8', shell: true }
).stdout.toString();

Task({
  prompt: trustValidatorPrompt,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "sonnet"
});
```

This creates a specialized agent with:
- **Expertise**: Legal Analyst
- **Personality**: Meticulous, Cautious, Thorough
- **Approach**: Thorough
- **Voice**: Joseph (authoritative, British, ID: Zlb1dXrM7653N07WRdFW3)

The agent brings domain expertise and personality to trust document validation with ATO-compliant retention tracking and pre-EOFY compliance monitoring.
