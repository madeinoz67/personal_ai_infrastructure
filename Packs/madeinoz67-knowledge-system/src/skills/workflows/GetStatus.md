# Get Status Workflow

**Objective:** Check the operational status of the Graphiti knowledge graph, server health, and database connectivity.

---

## Step 1: Announce Workflow

```bash
~/.claude/Tools/SkillWorkflowNotification GetStatus PaiKnowledgeSystem
```

**Output to user:**
```
Running the **GetStatus** workflow from the **PaiKnowledgeSystem** skill...
```

---

## Step 2: Check Server Health

**Verify Graphiti MCP server is running:**

```bash
# Check if server responds
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status": "healthy"}
```

**If server is not reachable:**
```bash
# Check if container is running (using pack status script)
bash src/server/status.sh

# Or check container logs
bash src/server/logs.sh | head -50
```

---

## Step 3: Call MCP Status Tool

**Get detailed status from knowledge graph:**

```typescript
// Use the get_status tool
get_status({})
```

**This returns:**
- Server connection status
- Database connectivity (FalkorDB/Neo4j)
- LLM provider configuration
- Basic graph statistics (if available)

---

## Step 4: Present Status Report

**Format status information for user:**

```markdown

**✅ Health Summary**

Overall Status: [🟢 Healthy / 🟡 Warnings / 🔴 Issues]

[Additional notes or recommendations]
```

---

## Health Indicators

**🟢 Healthy Status:**
- Server responding to health checks
- Database connected and operational
- LLM provider configured
- No errors in logs
- Recent successful episode additions

**🟡 Warning Status:**
- Server running but slow response times
- High memory or CPU usage
- API key configured but rate limits low
- Recent episode failures
- High semaphore limit for API tier

**🔴 Critical Status:**
- Server not responding
- Database disconnected
- Missing or invalid API keys
- Container stopped or crashed
- No recent successful operations

---

## Troubleshooting by Status

**If Server Disconnected:**

```bash
# Start the server
cd /path/to/podman-graphiti-knowledge-graph-mcp
./run.sh

# Or if using podman-compose
podman-compose up -d

# Verify startup
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**If Database Disconnected:**

```bash
# Check database container
podman ps | grep falkordb  # or neo4j

# Check database logs
podman logs falkordb

# Restart database
podman restart falkordb

# Then restart MCP server
podman restart graphiti-knowledge-graph-mcp
```

**If API Key Issues:**

```bash
# Check .env file
cat ~/.claude/.env | grep API_KEY

# Verify API key is valid
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Update .env if needed
nano ~/.claude/.env

# Restart container to pick up changes
podman restart graphiti-knowledge-graph-mcp
```

**If High Resource Usage:**

```bash
# Check container stats
podman stats graphiti-knowledge-graph-mcp

# Reduce concurrency
# Edit .env: SEMAPHORE_LIMIT=5

# Restart to apply
podman restart graphiti-knowledge-graph-mcp
```

## Performance Metrics

**Track Over Time:**

```markdown
**Performance Trends:**

**Response Times:**
- Current: [X]ms
- Average (24h): [Y]ms
- Peak: [Z]ms

**Episode Throughput:**
- Last hour: [X] episodes
- Last 24h: [Y] episodes
- Last 7 days: [Z] episodes

**Error Rate:**
- Last hour: [X]%
- Last 24h: [Y]%
```

**Optimization Recommendations:**

Based on metrics, suggest:
- Adjust SEMAPHORE_LIMIT based on API tier
- Consider model upgrade if extraction quality is low
- Clean up old episodes if graph is too large
- Archive old knowledge to separate group_id

---

## Quick Health Commands

**One-Line Health Check:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health && echo "✓ Server healthy" || echo "✗ Server down"
```

**Container Status:**
```bash
podman ps --filter name=graphiti --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

**Recent Errors:**
```bash
podman logs --since 1h graphiti-knowledge-graph-mcp | grep -i error
```

**Database Connection Test:**
```bash
# FalkorDB (Redis)
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping

# Neo4j
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p demodemo "RETURN 1"
```

## Integration with Other Workflows

**Before Other Workflows:**
- Always run GetStatus before BulkImport to ensure capacity
- Check before CaptureEpisode if server seems slow
- Verify before ClearGraph (destructive operation)

**After Troubleshooting:**
- Re-run GetStatus to verify fixes
- Test with simple CaptureEpisode
- Check GetRecent to confirm operations work

---

**Related Workflows:**
- All other workflows - Run GetStatus first if experiencing issues
- `CaptureEpisode.md` - Test knowledge capture after troubleshooting
- `ClearGraph.md` - Check status before destructive operations
