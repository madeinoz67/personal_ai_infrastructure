# PAI OSINT Skill v1.3.0 - Installation Guide

**This guide is designed for AI agents installing this pack into a user's infrastructure.**

---

## AI Agent Instructions

**This is a wizard-style installation.** Use Claude Code's native tools to guide the user through installation:

1. **AskUserQuestion** - For user decisions and confirmations
2. **TodoWrite** - For progress tracking
3. **Bash/Read/Write** - For actual installation
4. **VERIFY.md** - For final validation

### Welcome Message

Before starting, greet the user:
```
"I'm installing pai-osint-skill v1.3.0 - AI-powered OSINT collection and analysis with iterative pivot-driven investigations.

Let me analyze your system and guide you through installation."
```

---

## Phase 1: System Analysis

**Execute this analysis BEFORE any file operations.**

### 1.1 Run These Commands

```bash
# Check PAI_DIR
echo "PAI_DIR: ${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"

# Check for existing osint skill
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint" ]; then
  echo "Existing osint skill found at: $PAI_DIR/skills/osint"
  ls -la "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint/"
else
  echo "No existing osint skill (clean install)"
fi

# Check for Browser skill (dependency)
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/skills/Browser" ]; then
  echo "Browser skill: INSTALLED"
else
  echo "Browser skill: NOT INSTALLED (optional but recommended)"
fi

# Check for Knowledge skill (dependency)
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/skills/Knowledge" ]; then
  echo "Knowledge skill: INSTALLED"
else
  echo "Knowledge skill: NOT INSTALLED (optional but recommended)"
fi

# Check for Agents skill (required dependency)
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/skills/Agents" ]; then
  echo "Agents skill: INSTALLED (required)"
else
  echo "Agents skill: NOT INSTALLED (required for agent delegation)"
fi

# Check for Bright Data MCP (recommended)
if grep -q "brightdata" "$HOME/.claude.json" 2>/dev/null || grep -q "brightdata" "$HOME/.claude/settings.json" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "Bright Data MCP: CONFIGURED (recommended)"
else
  echo ""
  echo "RECOMMENDATION: Bright Data MCP"
  echo "  For enhanced web scraping and search capabilities, consider adding Bright Data MCP."
  echo "  This enables advanced search and scraping through brightdata's web unlocker."
  echo "  See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-mcp-servers#bright-data"
fi
```

### 1.2 Present Findings

Tell the user what you found:
```
"Here's what I found on your system:
- PAI_DIR: [path]

## Phase 3: Backup (If Needed)

**Only execute if user chose "Backup and Replace":**

```bash
# Create backup
BACKUP_DIR="$PAI_DIR/Backups/osint-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup existing osint skill
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint" ]; then
  cp -r "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint" "$BACKUP_DIR/"
  echo "osint skill backed up to: $BACKUP_DIR"
fi

# Backup existing research directory
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/history/research/osint" ]; then
  cp -r "$PAI_DIR/history/research/osint" "$BACKUP_DIR/"
  echo "Research directory backed up to: $BACKUP_DIR"
fi

echo "Backup complete at: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

---

## Phase 4: Installation

**Before installing, locate the pack source:**

```bash
# Determine where pai-osint-skill pack is located
# If cloned from git
PACK_SOURCE="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/Packs/pai-osint-skill"

# If downloaded archive or current directory
PACK_SOURCE="$(pwd)"

# Verify pack contents exist
if [ -f "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/SKILL.md" ]; then
  echo "✓ Pack source located at: $PACK_SOURCE"
else
  echo "✗ Pack source not found. Please navigate to the pai-osint-skill directory"
  echo "  or specify the full path to PACK_SOURCE"
  exit 1
fi

# List what will be installed
echo ""
echo "Files to be installed:"
ls -1 "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/SKILL.md"
ls -1 "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/Workflows/"*.md
echo ""
echo "Total workflows: $(ls -1 "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/Workflows/"*.md | wc -l | xargs)"
```

**Create a TodoWrite list to track progress:**

```json
{
  "todos": [
    {"content": "Create directory structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating directory structure"},
    {"content": "Copy SKILL.md", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Copying skill definition"},
    {"content": "Copy all 16 workflows", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Copying workflow files"},
    {"content": "Sync voice configuration", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Syncing voice configuration"},
    {"content": "Run verification", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Running verification checks"}
  ]
}
```

### 4.1 Create Directory Structure

**Mark todo "Create directory structure" as in_progress.**

```bash
# Create skill directories
mkdir -p $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/Workflows

# Verify creation
ls -la $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/
```

**Mark todo as completed.**

### 4.2 Copy SKILL.md

**Mark todo "Copy SKILL.md" as in_progress.**

```bash
# Copy skill definition using PACK_SOURCE variable
cp "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/SKILL.md" $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/

# Verify skill name is lowercase
grep "^name:" $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/SKILL.md
# Should show: name: osint
```

**Mark todo as completed.**

### 4.3 Copy All 17 Workflows

**Mark todo "Copy all 17 workflows" as in_progress.**

```bash
# Copy all workflow files using PACK_SOURCE variable
cp "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/Workflows/"*.md $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/Workflows/

# Verify count
ls $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/Workflows/*.md | wc -l
# Should show: 17
```

**Expected workflows:**
1. InvestigationOrchestrator.md (NEW - iterative pivot-driven investigations)
2. UsernameRecon.md
3. DomainRecon.md
4. SocialCapture.md
5. InfraMapping.md
6. EntityLinking.md
7. TimelineAnalysis.md
8. TargetProfile.md
9. IntelReport.md
10. CompanyProfile.md
11. CorporateStructure.md
12. FinancialRecon.md
13. CompetitorAnalysis.md
14. RiskAssessment.md
15. EmailRecon.md
16. PhoneRecon.md
17. ImageRecon.md

**Mark todo as completed.**

### 4.4 Sync Voice Configuration

**Mark todo "Sync voice configuration" as in_progress.**

The OSINT pack includes pre-configured voices for each agent persona. This step syncs
those voices to the VoiceServer so agents speak immediately after installation.

```bash
# Navigate to pack source (use PACK_SOURCE set earlier)
cd "$PACK_SOURCE"

# Run voice sync (dry-run first to preview changes)
bun run src/tools/voice-sync.ts --dry-run --verbose

# Apply changes
bun run src/tools/voice-sync.ts --verbose
```

**What this does:**
- Reads voice configuration from `config/voices.json`
- Compares against `$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/voice-personalities.json`
- Adds new OSINT agent voices (preserves existing voices)
- Automatically restarts VoiceServer to load new voices
- Idempotent - safe to run multiple times

**Pre-configured voices (ElevenLabs public voices):**

| Agent | Voice | Gender | Voice ID | Role |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|------|
| collector | Rachel | Female | `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` | Intelligence gatherer |
| linker | Daniel | Male | `onwK4e9ZLuTAKqWW03F9` | Pattern recognition |
| auditor | Sarah | Female | `EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL` | Due diligence |
| shadow | Clyde | Male | `2EiwWnXFnvU5JabPnv8n` | Adversarial ops |
| verifier | Adam | Male | `pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB` | Source verification |

Users can customize voices later by editing `$PAI_DIR/VoiceServer/voice-personalities.json`
or the pack's `config/voices.json` and re-running the sync with `--force`.

**Mark todo as completed.**

---

## Phase 5: Verification

**Mark todo "Run verification" as in_progress.**

**Execute all checks from VERIFY.md:**

```bash
export PAI_DIR=${PAI_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}

echo "=== PAI OSINT Skill Verification ==="
echo ""

PASS=0
FAIL=0
WARN=0

# Core Structure
echo "Core Structure:"
if [ -d "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint" ]; then echo "  osint directory"; ((PASS++)); else echo "  osint directory"; ((FAIL++)); fi
if [ -f "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint/SKILL.md" ]; then echo "  SKILL.md"; ((PASS++)); else echo "  SKILL.md"; ((FAIL++)); fi
if grep -q "^name: osint$" "$PAI_DIR/skills/osint/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null; then echo "  Skill name lowercase"; ((PASS++)); else echo "  Skill name not lowercase"; ((FAIL++)); fi

echo ""
echo "Results: $PASS passed, $FAIL failed, $WARN warnings"
echo ""

if [ $FAIL -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "OSINT System installation VERIFIED"
else
  echo "Installation incomplete - review failed checks"
fi
```

**Mark todo as completed when all VERIFY.md checks pass.**

---

## Phase 6: Voice Test

**Test that OSINT agent voices are working correctly.**

### 6.1 Quick Voice Test

Run the voice test script to verify each OSINT agent voice:

```bash
cd "$PACK_SOURCE"
bun run src/tools/voice-test.ts
```

This will:
- Send a test phrase to VoiceServer for each OSINT agent
- Verify audio is generated successfully
- Report pass/fail for each voice

### 6.2 Manual Voice Test (Optional)

Test individual voices via curl:

```bash
# Test collector voice (Rachel)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "OSINT", "message": "Intelligence collection complete. Sources verified.", "voice_name": "collector"}'

# Test shadow voice (Clyde)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "OSINT", "message": "Attack surface analysis reveals critical exposure.", "voice_name": "shadow"}'

# Test auditor voice (Sarah)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "OSINT", "message": "Red flag identified. Recommend further investigation.", "voice_name": "auditor"}'
```

### 6.3 Expected Results

| Agent | Voice | Should Sound |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| collector | Rachel | Calm, measured, academic |
| linker | Daniel | Sophisticated, British accent |
| auditor | Sarah | Authoritative, professional |
| shadow | Clyde | Intense, gravelly |
| verifier | Adam | Warm, careful |

**Mark Phase 6 as completed when voices are verified.**

See docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md for all commands."
```

### On Failure

```
"Installation encountered issues. Here's what to check:

1. Verify $PAI_DIR is set correctly (default: ~/.claude)
2. Ensure all 16 workflow files were copied
3. Check SKILL.md has lowercase name 'osint'
4. Check VERIFY.md for the specific failing check

Need help? See Troubleshooting section below."
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "osint directory not found"

```bash
# Create directory manually
mkdir -p $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/Workflows
```

### "Skill name not lowercase"

```bash
# Edit SKILL.md to fix name
# Change: name: OSINT
# To:     name: osint
```

### "Workflows missing"

```bash
# Re-copy from pack source using PACK_SOURCE variable
PACK_SOURCE="/path/to/pai-osint-skill"  # Adjust to your path
cp "$PACK_SOURCE/src/skills/osint/Workflows/"*.md $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/Workflows/
```

### "Knowledge integration missing"

Workflows should contain: `Use the **knowledge** skill`

```bash
# Check which workflows are missing
for f in $PAI_DIR/skills/osint/Workflows/*.md; do
  if ! grep -q 'Use the \*\*knowledge\*\* skill' "$f"; then
    echo "Missing: $(basename $f)"
  fi
done
```

### "Browser skill not installed"

```bash
# Install browser skill first (optional)
# OSINT will work without it but with reduced web scraping capability
```

### "Knowledge skill not installed"

```bash
# Install pai-knowledge-system pack first
# The knowledge skill handles its own MCP and database configuration
```
