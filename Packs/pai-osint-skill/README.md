## Installation Prompt

You are receiving a PAI Pack - a modular upgrade for AI agent systems.

**What is PAI?** See: [PAI Project Overview](../README.md#what-is-pai)

**What is a Pack?** See: [Pack System](../README.md#the-journey-pai-v1x--v20)

This pack transforms your AI into an intelligence-gathering platform. The PAI OSINT Skill provides comprehensive workflows for:

- **Person Investigation** - Username enumeration, social media capture, entity linking
- **Domain Intelligence** - DNS, WHOIS, certificate transparency, subdomain discovery
- **Company Research** - Corporate profiles, ownership tracing, financial analysis, risk assessment
- **Knowledge Persistence** - All findings stored to knowledge graph via the **knowledge** skill

**Core principle:** Systematic collection, intelligent analysis, persistent storage.

No more scattered notes across sessions. Your investigations build on each other through the knowledge graph.

Please follow the installation instructions in `INSTALL.md` to integrate this pack into your infrastructure.

## The Concept and/or Problem

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations suffer from fragmentation:

**For Individual Targets:**
- Usernames scattered across 400+ platforms with no systematic enumeration
- Social media profiles captured ad-hoc, never correlated
- Timeline patterns invisible without structured analysis
- Identity links between accounts discovered by accident, not method

**For Company Research:**
- Corporate structures buried in registries across jurisdictions
- Beneficial ownership hidden behind shell companies
- Financial data scattered across SEC filings, funding databases, news
- Risk signals (litigation, sanctions, adverse media) require multiple searches

**For Intelligence Operations:**
- Each investigation starts from scratch with no institutional memory
- Findings stored in notes that can't be queried
- Relationships between entities discovered once, then forgotten
- No systematic methodology leads to inconsistent results

**The Fundamental Problem:**

Traditional OSINT is manual, fragmented, and ephemeral. Investigators repeat work, miss connections, and lose findings between sessions. There's no accumulation of intelligence over time.

## The Solution

The PAI OSINT Skill provides **structured, persistent, knowledge-graph-backed intelligence collection**.

**Architecture:**

                    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**The Intelligence Cycle:**

Each workflow follows a consistent 5-step pattern:

1. **Planning** - Define scope, legal/ethical boundaries, OPSEC
2. **Collection** - Systematic acquisition from public sources
3. **Processing** - Normalizing, enriching, correlating data
4. **Analysis** - Identifying patterns, relationships, risk
5. **Storage** - Persist to knowledge graph AND file reports

**Design Principles:**

1. **Workflow-Driven**: 16 specialized workflows for different intelligence tasks
2. **Knowledge-First**: Every workflow stores to knowledge graph via the **knowledge** skill
3. **Dual Storage**: Both queryable graph AND human-readable file reports
4. **Ethical by Design**: Legal considerations built into every workflow
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without dependencies, better with them

---

## What Makes This Different

The OSINT System has 3 architectural layers:

1. **Intent Routing (SKILL.md)** - Triggers map natural language to workflows
2. **Workflow Execution (Workflows/)** - Structured steps with knowledge persistence
3. **Knowledge Storage (knowledge skill)** - Entities and relationships in graph

```
User: "investigate company Acme Corp"

         ▼

│ Group: osint-companies  │
│ Relationships mapped    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Architecture Matters:**

- **Explicit Routing**: Intent → Workflow → Storage, not fuzzy matching
- **Persistent Memory**: Every investigation adds to the knowledge graph
- **Cross-Investigation Linking**: Entity discovered in one workflow appears in future searches
- **Audit Trail**: Full methodology documented for each collection

---

## Why This Is Different

This sounds similar to using search engines manually which also finds public information. What makes this approach different?

The OSINT System transforms ad-hoc searching into systematic intelligence collection. Each workflow follows a repeatable methodology, stores findings to a queryable knowledge graph, and builds institutional memory across investigations. Future queries automatically surface past findings.

- Structured workflows replace random searching with methodology
- Knowledge graph stores entities and relationships permanently
- Cross-investigation linking surfaces connections automatically
- Dual storage provides both queryable and human-readable outputs

---

## Installation

**Quick Install:**
1. Run the analysis commands to check prerequisites
2. Answer questions about your OSINT needs
3. Copy skill files to `$PAI_DIR/skills/osint/`
4. Verify with `VERIFY.md` checklist

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Iterative Pivot-Driven Investigation (NEW)

```
User: "Deep dive on username johndoe"

System executes InvestigationOrchestrator workflow:

PHASE 1: Initial Collection (Parallel Agents)
├── UsernameRecon Agent → Found 15 accounts
├── SocialCapture Agent → Captured 8 profiles
└── DomainRecon Agent → Found personal domain

PHASE 2: Pivot Detection
├── Email discovered: john@example.com (HIGH priority)
├── Company discovered: Acme Corp (MEDIUM priority)
└── Domain discovered: johndoe.dev (MEDIUM priority)

PHASE 3: User Approval (Interactive Mode)
"Found 3 pivot opportunities. Pursue 1,2,3 or defer?"

PHASE 4: Expansion (Depth 1)
├── EmailRecon Agent → 2 breach exposures
├── CompanyProfile Agent → Corporate structure mapped
└── DomainRecon Agent → WHOIS, hosting analyzed

PHASE 5: Synthesis & Report
└── Comprehensive dossier with 27 entities, 45 relationships

Output: Investigation complete. Deferred pivots saved to Knowledge Graph.
```

### Example 2: Username Reconnaissance

```
User: "Find all accounts for username johndoe"

System executes UsernameRecon workflow:
1. Searches 400+ platforms for "johndoe"
2. Validates discovered accounts
3. Extracts profile metadata
4. Stores to knowledge graph (group: osint-usernames)
5. Saves report to $PAI_DIR/history/research/osint/

Output: Found 15 accounts, stored to knowledge graph
```

### Example 2: Company Due Diligence

```
User: "Do a risk assessment on Vendor LLC"

System executes RiskAssessment workflow:
1. Searches litigation databases (PACER, state courts)
2. Checks sanctions lists (OFAC, EU, UK)
3. Scans adverse media
4. Reviews regulatory filings
5. Stores findings to knowledge graph (group: osint-risk)

Output: Risk profile generated with 3 litigation cases identified
```

### Example 3: Full Target Investigation

```
User: "Full profile for target johndoe scope comprehensive"

System executes TargetProfile workflow:
1. Runs UsernameRecon
2. Runs DomainRecon (if domains found)
3. Runs SocialCapture
4. Runs EntityLinking
5. Runs TimelineAnalysis
6. Generates consolidated report
7. Stores complete profile to knowledge graph

Output: Comprehensive dossier with 23 entities, 45 relationships
```
