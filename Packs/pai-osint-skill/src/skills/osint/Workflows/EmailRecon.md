# Email Reconnaissance Workflow

Comprehensive email address investigation including validation, breach exposure, social correlation, and domain analysis.

## Trigger Phrases
- "email lookup"
- "investigate email"
- "email OSINT"
- "check email breaches"
- "find accounts for email"
- "email reconnaissance"
- "who owns this email"

## Input
- `email`: The email address to investigate (e.g., john.doe@example.com)
- `headers`: (Optional) Raw email headers for header analysis

---

## REQUIRED: Agent Delegation

**This workflow MUST be executed by a specialized OSINT agent via the Task tool.**

### Step 1: Generate Agent Prompt
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Agents/Tools/AgentFactory.ts \
  --traits "intelligence,analytical,systematic" \
  --task "Investigate email '{email}' including validation, breach exposure, social correlation, and domain analysis" \
  --output json
```

### Step 2: Spawn Subagent (MANDATORY)

**IMMEDIATELY after getting the AgentFactory output, use the Task tool:**

```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  description: "OSINT email recon for {email}"
  prompt: |
    [Paste the "prompt" field from AgentFactory JSON]

    ## Workflow Instructions
    [Include the Process steps below]

    ## Voice Output Required
    Include 🗣️ Recon: or 🗣️ Analyst: lines at start, key findings, and completion.
```

**Agent Traits:**
- `intelligence` - OSINT expertise and breach database knowledge
- `analytical` - Systematic breach and account correlation
- `systematic` - Structured investigation methodology

⚠️ **FORBIDDEN: Executing this workflow directly without the Task tool spawn.**
⚠️ **WHY: Voice system requires SubagentStop hook, which only fires for Task subagents.**

## Process

### Step 1: Email Validation
```
Verify email deliverability:
- Syntax validation (RFC 5322)
- MX record check for domain
- SMTP connection test (if authorized)
- Disposable email detection
- Role-based email detection (info@, support@, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Email Format Analysis
```
Parse and analyze email components:
- Local part: john.doe
- Domain: example.com
- Naming patterns detected (firstname.lastname, firstlast, etc.)
- Common variations generated:
  - j.doe@example.com
  - johndoe@example.com
  - john_doe@example.com
  - jdoe@example.com
```

### Step 3: Breach Database Check
```
Query breach databases:
- HaveIBeenPwned API
  - Breach names and dates
  - Data types exposed (passwords, phone, address)
  - Paste appearances
- Additional breach sources (if available)
  - DeHashed (with authorization)
  - IntelX (with API key)

Output:
- Number of breaches
- Breach timeline
- Severity assessment
- Exposed data categories
```

### Step 4: Email-to-Social Correlation
```
Discover linked accounts:

1. Gravatar:
   - Hash email (MD5) and query Gravatar API
   - Retrieve avatar image
   - Profile data if available

2. GitHub:
   - Search commits by email
   - Author/committer matching
   - Repository associations

3. Social Platforms:
   - Hunter.io profile search
   - EmailRep.io social indicators
   - LinkedIn (limited without auth)
   - Twitter/X email search (if authorized)

4. Professional Directories:
   - Domain-associated directories
   - Industry-specific lookups
   - Company employee pages

5. Password Reset Pages:
   - Check for account existence indicators
   - Platform-specific enumeration (ethical, no exploitation)
```

### Step 5: Domain Analysis
```
Analyze email domain:
- MX records (mail server infrastructure)
- SPF record (authorized senders)
- DMARC policy (email authentication)
- DKIM selectors (if discoverable)
- Domain registration (WHOIS)
- Organization type (corporate, personal, provider)
```

### Step 6: Email Header Analysis
```
If email sample headers provided:
- Trace routing path (Received headers)
- Originating IP address
- Mail client/User-Agent
- Authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Time zone indicators
- X-headers analysis
- Detect spoofing indicators
```

### Step 7: Reputation Assessment
```
Email reputation scoring:
- EmailRep.io reputation check
- Spam database presence
- Blacklist status
- Trust score calculation
- Risk indicators
```

### Step: Output for Memory Capture

Format output with proper metadata so memory hooks can capture it automatically. Include frontmatter with type: research, category: osint

```
Store the following as structured episodes:

1. Email Entity:
   - Name: "Email: {email}"
   - Data: Email address, domain, local part, validation status, reputation score
   - Group: "osint-emails"

2. Breach Exposure:
   - Name: "Breaches: {email}"
   - Data: Breach list, dates, exposed data types, severity
   - Relationships: exposed_in breach entities
   - Temporal metadata for timeline

3. Linked Accounts:
   - Name: "Accounts: {email}"
   - Data: Platform name, URL, username, confidence level
   - Relationships: owns_account, linked_to email entity

4. Gravatar Profile:
   - Name: "Gravatar: {email}"
   - Data: Avatar URL, hash, profile data
   - Relationships: avatar_for email entity

5. Domain Association:
   - Name: "Domain: {domain}"
   - Data: MX records, SPF, DMARC, organization
   - Relationships: email_domain_of email entity

6. Header Analysis (if provided):
   - Name: "Headers: {email}/{date}"
   - Data: Routing path, originating IP, auth results, anomalies
   - Relationships: received_from, routed_through
```
