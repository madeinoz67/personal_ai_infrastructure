## REQUIRED: Agent Delegation

**This workflow MUST be executed by a specialized OSINT agent with security expertise.**

```bash
# Spawn risk assessment agent
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/Agents/Tools/AgentFactory.ts \
  --traits "intelligence,security,skeptical" \
  --task "Conduct risk assessment for '{company}' including litigation, regulatory status, sanctions screening, adverse media, and ESG evaluation" \
  --output json
```

**Agent Traits:**
- `intelligence` - OSINT expertise and due diligence tradecraft
- `security` - Understanding of threat models and risk frameworks
- `skeptical` - Critical evaluation of claims, demand evidence

**For Enhanced Due Diligence:** Add `thorough` approach trait for exhaustive analysis.
