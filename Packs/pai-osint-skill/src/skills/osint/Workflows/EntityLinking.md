# Entity Linking Workflow

Cross-reference and link entities across multiple data sources for identity resolution.

## Trigger Phrases
- "link entities"
- "find connections"
- "identity resolution"
- "connect accounts"
- "cross-reference"

## Input
- `entities`: List of entities to analyze (usernames, emails, domains, names)

## Process

### Step 1: Entity Extraction
```
Parse inputs to identify:
- Usernames/handles
- Email addresses
- Domain names
- Real names
- Phone numbers
- IP addresses
```

### Step 2: Search Knowledge Graph
```
Query existing intelligence:
- Known entities matching inputs
- Existing relationships
- Previous investigations
```

### Step 3: Cross-Platform Username Search
```
For each username:
- Search across known platforms
- Identify matching profiles
- Compare profile metadata
```

### Step 4: Email Correlation
```
For each email:
- Search breach databases (ethical sources)
- Check domain associations
- Identify linked accounts
```

### Step 5: Writing Style Analysis
```
If text content available:
- Analyze writing patterns
- Compare linguistic features
- Note distinctive phrases
```

### Step 6: Temporal Correlation
```
Compare activity timelines:
- Account creation dates
- Posting patterns
- Activity overlaps
```

### Step 7: Network Overlap Analysis
```
Compare social networks:
- Mutual followers/friends
- Shared group memberships
- Interaction patterns
```

### Step 8: Generate Link Graph
```
Create relationship map:
- Confirmed links (same person)
- Probable links (high confidence)
- Possible links (requires verification)
- Related entities (associated but different)
```

### Step: Output for Memory Capture

Format output with proper metadata so memory hooks can capture it automatically. Include frontmatter: the entity links:

```
Store the following as structured episodes:

1. Resolved Identity:
   - Name: "Identity: {primary_identifier}"
   - Data: Primary identifier, all linked accounts, confidence score
   - Group: "osint-identities"

2. Confirmed Links:
   - Name: "Link: {entity1} = {entity2}"
   - Data: Evidence (matching email, profile pics, bios), confidence percentage
   - Relationships: same_person_as, confirmed_link

3. Probable Links:
   - Name: "ProbableLink: {entity1} ~ {entity2}"
   - Data: Evidence, confidence percentage, verification needed
   - Relationships: likely_same_as

4. Correlation Evidence:
   - Name: "Evidence: {primary_identifier}"
   - Data: Profile picture matches, writing style, temporal patterns, network overlap
   - Supporting data for future verification

5. Link Matrix:
   - Name: "Matrix: {investigation_id}"
   - Data: Full cross-reference matrix with all confidence scores
```

## Linking Criteria

### High Confidence (>80%)
- Same email verified on multiple platforms
- Profile picture exact match
- Explicit cross-linking in bios
- Same unique identifier (website, phone)

### Medium Confidence (50-80%)
- Similar usernames + overlapping networks
- Writing style correlation
- Temporal activity patterns match
- Partial email match

### Low Confidence (<50%)
